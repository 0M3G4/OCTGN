To work on the web component
-------------------------------------------------
**Note:** This project is not included in the main project, because having it included makes it unable to be opened from 
express editions, and we want to keep the development process open to all.  It requires the main project to be built so 
it can include the required assemblies.

* Open the subproject file under **Webcontent/Webcontent.csproj** with the web developer version of Visual Studio Express
* **Important** This project references two components from the main project, you will have to add them as references
  * OCTGN\octgnFX\Skylabs.Lobby\bin\Debug\Skylabs.Lobby.dll 
  * OCTGN\octgnFX\Octgn\bin\Debug\Skylabs.LobbyServer.exe

# Python
Octgn uses IronPython for its in-game scripting engine.

The python definitions go in PythonApi.py. You can call outside code with the following syntax:  _api.function_name and it will call the corresponding function in ScriptApi.cs.
For example, the following code found in PythonApi.py is the random function:
```def rnd(min, max):
  return _api.Random(min, max)```

It calls Random with a min and max value that is location in ScriptApi.cs.
